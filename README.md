# Kudu

Kudu is my toy language that is written in Go. It is still a work in progress and I wouldn't
recommend anyone to actually use it. I will try to update this README at some point with
the spec for the language. The plan is to have an interpretter and possible a transpiler
to Go just for simplicity. It would then be trivial to create a compiler that just outsources
the work to the Go compiler toolchain.
